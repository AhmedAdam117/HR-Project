Project Description: Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation using SQL Server and Power BI
This project aimed to analyze employee data and create an interactive dashboard using SQL Server for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The focus was on key metrics such as age distribution, gender diversity, job roles, tenure, turnover rates, and regional distribution.

The process began by extracting data from multiple tables in SQL Server, including employee demographics, departments, and job titles. SQL queries were used to filter, aggregate, and join the data, ensuring the dataset was clean and relevant. Missing values were handled through imputation or removal, and outliers were detected and verified.

Once the data was cleaned, it was categorized into meaningful groups, such as age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35), and metrics like turnover rate and average tenure by department were calculated. Key insights were drawn from the gender distribution across departments and turnover trends, while a geographical analysis of employee distribution by state was performed.

The transformed data was then imported into Power BI, where relationships between tables were established to create a unified data model. Various visualizations were used, including bar charts, pie charts, and KPI indicators to present the data. Filters were added to allow interactive exploration, enabling users to drill down into specific departments, job titles, or time periods.

The final deliverable was an interactive dashboard that provided real-time insights into workforce demographics, turnover trends, and department performance, helping HR and leadership make data-driven decisions.
